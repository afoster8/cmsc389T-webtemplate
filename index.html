                <p>Hello! My name is Amanda Foster, and I am a senior computer science and linguistics double major, interested in natural language processing, 
                 computational linguistics, and machine learning. I am currently pursuing a double degree -- a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelors of Arts in Linguistics.</p>

                <p> Prior to attending UMD, I earned an Associates of Applied Science in Radiography and currently hold a radiography license from the Maryland Board of Physicians. In other words, 
                    I work at a hospital taking xrays for patients to help physicians diagnose fractures, lung disease, and other illnesses. Radiography is fun, fulfilling, and necessary work, but 
                    I discovered that I am most fulfilled when I am learning new things. Throughout my time at the University of Maryland, I have experimented with a variety of interest areas, 
                    including psychology, nutritional science, various foreign languages, and philosophy, among many others. The one subject that kept me up at night, working tirelessly to solve 
                    puzzles and get tests to pass, was computer science. Luckily for me, CS is an area where learning never ends, and I can pursue many of my interest areas while solving puzzles 
                    and making a measurable difference.  </p>

                <p> Beyond CS, I love learning languages (dabbled in French, Japanese, American Sign Language so far), reading, and podcasts. </p>

                    <h2>Data Science Tutorial</h2>
                    <p>I created a tutorial that shows the process of exploratory data analysis and applying basic
                        machine learning techniques to a dataset. In particular, I used a dataset of collected user scores for animated television shows from a popular website MyAnimeList.
                        The tutorial explains how to analyze data and create a model to predict user scores based on genre, number of scores, themes, and other factors. The tutorial is viewable
                        <a href="https://afoster8.github.io/">here.</a>

                    <h2>Lambda Calculus Interpreter</h2>
                    <p>For a CMSC330 (Organization of Programming Langauges) project, I created a lambda calculus interpreter that tokenized, parsed, and evaluated lambda calculus expressions using 
                        OCaml. </p>

                    <h2>Phonetic Analysis of Uptalk</h2>
                    <p>For the LING320 (Phonetics) final project, I analyzed the pitch production of a collection of speakers who produce uptalk, a linguistic phenomenon in which speakers 
                        raise the pitch of their speech at the end of a statement. Using the software Praat and audio clips from YouTube, I segmented and annotated instances of uptalk and 
                        measured the pitch slope and pitch ratio of these instances versus instances of questions. I found a significant difference between question and uptalk pitch slope, 
                        suggesting that uptalk is a linguistic innovation rather than a reappropriation of the question pitch pattern. </p>
